        <dfn>Chemistry</dfn> is the branch of science concerned with the
        substances of which matter is composed, the investigation of their
        properties and reactions, and the use of such reactions to form new
        substances.

        <dfn><strong>Biochemistry</strong></dfn
        >is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at
        the cellular and molecular level. It emerged as a distinct discipline
        around the beginning of the 20th century when scientists combined
        chemistry, physiology, and biology to investigate the chemistry of
        living systems.
